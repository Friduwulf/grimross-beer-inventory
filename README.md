# Grimross Brewing Corproation Inventory Tracker

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to get a base level understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and it was undertaken as both a way to learn the basics, but also to provide me with a tool for study. One that can be added to over time, and in doing so will practice the skills noted within the study guide. By making this project, I have become familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and how they all tie together. I've also learned how to solve problems that arise along the way.

This project is designed to receive input via a google sheet, and then store that data in a database sheet, to then be manipulated and outup to an output sheet. The purpose is to track the taproom sale, warehouse sale, loss, and packaged product, and provide an easy to understand output full of analysis points. The end goal is to develop this with machine learning to analyize sale patterns, and develop a brew schedule to help breweries always have inventory when needed, but not an overstock that will last months.

## Installation

Included in this repo, is a link to a blank copy of the google sheet for which this was designed. That sheet can be copied and then have this script attached to it.

## Usage

This repo can be used to better understand the inventory management of any production and sale based business, such as craft breweries.
